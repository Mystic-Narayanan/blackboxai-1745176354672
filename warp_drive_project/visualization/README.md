# Visualization Components

This directory will contain visualization scripts and tools to demonstrate the results of the warp drive simulations.

Currently, the simulation script `warp_drive_simulation.py` includes basic plotting of the warp bubble motion over time.

Future visualization enhancements may include:
- 3D visualizations of spacetime curvature
- Interactive simulations using web technologies
- Animations of warp bubble dynamics

Required Python libraries for visualization:
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

Ensure these are installed to run the visualization scripts.
