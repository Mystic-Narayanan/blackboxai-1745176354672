# Warp Drive Invention Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the theoretical foundations and simulation of a warp drive, a concept from advanced physics that proposes faster-than-light travel by warping spacetime. The ultimate goal is to invent and build a warp drive, advancing technology 400 years into the future.

## Objectives
- Understand and document warp drive theory, including the Alcubierre drive concept.
- Develop simulation scripts to model warp drive physics and spacetime metrics.
- Create visualization tools to demonstrate simulation results.
- Maintain research notes and references for ongoing study.
- Outline a conceptual roadmap for progressing from simulation to invention.

## Project Structure
- `simulation/`: Contains physics simulation scripts.
- `visualization/`: Visualization components for simulation results.
- `docs/`: Research notes, references, and experimental ideas.
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation.

## Getting Started
This project uses Python for simulations and visualizations. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with necessary libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.

## Future Work
- Expand simulations with more detailed physics models.
- Explore experimental setups and engineering challenges.
- Collaborate with physicists and engineers for practical development.
